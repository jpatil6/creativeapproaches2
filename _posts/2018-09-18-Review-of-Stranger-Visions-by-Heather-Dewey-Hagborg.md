In 'Stranger Visions' the artist, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, collected personal traces like hair, cigarette butts, and chewing gum, that strangers unwittingly left behind in public spaces. The genetic material from these artifacts was extracted, and analyzed to construct computationally generated 3D printed portrait sculptures. 

These plastic facial reconstructions with their indistinct hollow gazes were displayed on a white wall much like animal trophy heads. A black box below the sculpture exhibited the refuse material from which the genetic material was retrieved, an image of where it was recovered from, and a brief description of the genetic details obtained.     

The bizarre trophy display of faces with deadpan eyes, and refuse material from the streets, made me recoil at first impression. As I explored the startling definition of facial characteristics in the sculptures, I was amazed by the rich potential for information contained in these nearly unavoidable biological 'footprints' of our existence. The fascination soon turned to alarm and vulnerability at the thought of how easily someone can pick up on my biological 'footprint' and violate my (genomic) privacy.

The artist doesn't simply present the message of the art, but lets the art drag the viewer through these rollercoaster responses and discover the theme by themselves. What seems to begin as an exploration of abstract genetic identity, and its startlingly mundane physical manifestation in our refuse, grows into a sign of caution on the fragility of genomic privacy, and a larger debate over the social and ethical implications of genomic data collection, its use, and potential biases.

Oddly, what appealed to me most about this art was that it unsettled me at first glance. As a viewer with little to no context of genetic identification

Consider aspects like content, form, style, context, etc. Be thorough and thoughtful.

What is it? - form, content (100)
- computationally generated portraits from DNA found in public spaces
- Inorganic representations of the face, deadpan eyes
- Ordinary, slightly repulsive 'footprint' of our existence

What is the piece trying to do or say? (100)
- Explores how our genetic identity manifests in the most ordinary of our refuse\n
- Raise awareness of the fragility of genomic privacy\n
- Communicate the dangers of data collection and bias esp. with genomic data\n

What about the piece appeals to you? What works about it? (100)
- It unsettles me
- Art with a cause: How an exploration of identity lead to a campaign for privacy
- Tech-human interface.
- Hits you in 2 waves - 1. thats kinda creepy and cool. 2. Thats really creepy
- It makes its message very relatable and personal.
- The art has a background and history. The depth gives it a richer character

What doesn't work? (50)
- First instinct is to shrink away from it. It startles and may immediately distance viewers.
- 

What could make it stronger, and what is adding to or taking away from its impact?(50)
- Instead should pull them in - intrigue - foot in the door

Conclusion:(50)
What is it really?
- Banksy - 'Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable' - I love the balance in this definition of art.
- This artpiece disturbs, but no comforting. there should be a positive note.
- Society keeping with technology
