A response to Julian Oliver's 'Stealth Internet' and Maciej Ceglowski's 'The Internet With A Human Face'.

As a child it was easy for me to rationalize things I had limited knowledge of. My attention was caught by things I could see, and
I'd model them using partial information and a little imagination. My idea of the internet was thus largely bound by the monitor screen
through which I interacted with it. The screen was a little window into the computer's mind and the internet was just a stream of 
information that was delivered to the computer's mind that sat in the big black box, much like how letters are delivered by a postman.

Even as I grew to learn that this wasn't exactly how it worked, I was not very concerned with the specifics of it.I justifiably reasoned that if my interpretation of the system satisfactorily explained my limited interaction with its user interface, I had little reason to confuse myself with the inner workings of it. I later did learn more about the internet's inner workings, not because as a user I felt I needed to, but just out of curiosity. Since I identified as an outsider looking into the systems of the internet, I would rationalize the way it worked to be the only way it could work. And I'm certain I am part of a much larger population that has found little reason to question the technology that facilitates so much of our daily lives.

So in reading Maciej Ceglowski's 'Internet With A Human Face', I was able to relate to his deconstruction of 'car culture' in the United States, but when he turned to the internet, I was taken aback. Not because I was unaware of the many issues that were symptomatic of the 'internet culture', but because I had never stopped to think that the internet can be designed to be different. The internet had attained mythic status.

I like that both Julian Oliver's 'Stealth Internet' and Maciej Ceglowski's 'The Internet With A Human Face', don't just leave the reader stumped thinking about the intangible ways in which the internet had grown to govern our lives. They break the internet down to into the material world of hidden internet infrastructure and people in internet corporations that determine the architecture of how our information is processed. In making the internet material, they deconstruct some of the mythic status around the internet and open it to scrutiny and change.

After reading the two articles, I don't yet feel entirely comfortable with questioning the paradigm of an omnipresent internet, but I am more willing to make minor changes in the way I consume it. I would be keen to support democratic scrutiny of the system architecture and its gradual reforms, but I feel I don't have enough of a foothold to be actively contributing to such a campaign. For now I must look more closely at my preconceived notions of the internet, learn the way it works, and understand the scope for improvement.
