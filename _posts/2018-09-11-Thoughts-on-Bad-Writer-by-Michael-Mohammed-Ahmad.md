Michael Mohammed Ahmad sums his understanding of poor creative writing in the
conversational narrative essay, 'Bad Writer'.

Drawing from refreshingly original personal anecdotes and an acute sense of humor,
the author describes the common features that characterize a 'bad writer'. 
Despite his blunt criticism of bad writing, he claims that instead of offending
bad writers, he "seeks to inspire bad writers, [and] to encourage them to take 
creative writing more seriously".
  
In the essay, I was particularly captured by an interesting claim he makes 
about bad writing: "bad writing in
Western Sydney has everything in common with bad writing everywhere else, good 
writing in Western Sydney, and good writing everywhere else, has nothing in common 
with good writing anywhere else". Given my scientific background, I was initially 
uncomfortable with this sweeping statement, but as I read the anecdotes he used to 
illustrate it, I developed my own interpretation of it. Given that bad and good are 
subjective terms, I think writing is considered characteristically bad, when it 
suffers from common errors such as clich√©s or lack of originality or research, thus 
forming a set that defines a threshold between bad and good writing.
Though bad writing may differ slightly from one another in degree, it is still part 
of the set that completely and characteristically defines it. On the other hand, 
any good writing outside this threshold may be good in varying 
degrees and for uniquely characteristic reasons.

Instead of building such an argument, the author invites the reader to construct 
their own understanding of it by putting forth entertaining narratives. 
Although I have little experience with creative writing, I thoroughly enjoyed 
how I was able to relate to the author's frustrations and hopes for writing in 
Western Sydney, by contextualizing it with my personal experiences in science.
