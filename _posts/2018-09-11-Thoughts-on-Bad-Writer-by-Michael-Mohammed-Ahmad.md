Michael Mohammed Ahmad sums his understanding of poor creative writing in the
conversational narrative essay, 'Bad Writer'.

Drawing from refreshingly original personal anecdotes and an acute sense of humor,
the author describes the common features that characterize a 'bad writer'. 
Despite his blunt criticism of bad writing, he claims that instead of offending
bad writers, he "seeks to inspire bad writers, [and] to encourage them to take 
creative writing more seriously".
  
In the essay, he maintains an interesting claim about bad writing: "bad writing in
Western Sydney has everything in common with bad writing everywhere else, good 
writing in Western Sydney, and good writing everywhere else, has nothing in common 
with good writing anywhere else". Given my scientific background, I was initially 
uncomfortable with this sweeping statement, but as I read the anecdotes he used to 
illustrate it, I developed my own interpretation of it. Given that bad and good are 
subjective terms, I think writing is considered characteristically bad, when it 
suffers from common errors such as clich√©s or lack of originality or specificity. 
All bad writing is considered a part of a set that defines a threshold between 
what is considered bad and good writing.
Though bad writing may differ slightly from one another in degree, it is still part 
of the set that completely and characteristically defines it. On the other hand, 
any good writing outside this threshold may be good in varying 
degrees and for uniquely characteristic reasons. If any writing is not unique, 
it suffers from lack of originality and may thus be considered bad.
