  Michael Mohammed Ahmad sums his understanding of poor creative writing in the conversational narrative essay, 'Bad Writer'. Drawing from refreshingly original personal anecdotes and an acute sense of humor, the author describes the common features that characterize a 'bad writer'. In the essay, he insists that instead of offending bad writers, he "seeks to inspire bad writers, [and] to encourage them to take creative writing more seriously".
