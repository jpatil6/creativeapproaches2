An art project by Jai Patil

In 'Being left behind', I collect self-reported data on the things a person thinks they throw away daily, and suspend these articles
of trash in a molded sculpture portrait of the person. Since there were several practical limitations in casting a person's face in resin, for the purpose of this project I have created a 3D model of the sculpture with the suspended articles of trash also represented and rendered in it.

Garbage is seldom given a second glance. Our interaction with waste is limited to a set of chores that we 
can perform with as little thought as tying our shoelaces. Garbage is often considered a natural consequence of our existence rather
than of our consumption, to the effect that many fail to engage with it and realise there is something interesting our trash is telling us.

Beyond just the environmental needs of engaging with waste and its management, there is also a wealth of information in our garbage that
we fail to consider. Anthropologists and archeologists have built our understanding of the distant past of humanity primarily by studying
what people left behind. Some research has even been focussed on sifting through excavated material from urban landfills to understand the
changing patterns of modern consumption.
If you were to sift through your neighbour's trash (which I don't recommnend you do), you may be
able to find out trivial things like what they ate the previous day or even senstive personal information through discarded documents
or some indication of a medical condition. It isn't difficult to envisage a framework within which this could be done systematically
for whole neighbourhoods or cities, thus threatening to create an unusual yet dangerous culture of personal surveillance from what we
leave behind.

In this art piece, I attempt to not only bring people's attention to the need for understanding and managing our consumption and waste,
but also to have people engage with how their trash reflects their identity. There is often a little disgust and repulsion in handling
trash. I wanted to try breaking this conception by making trash personal and portraying it as aesthetic and pleasing.

### How I made it:

I used a Xbox kinect sensor to create a 3D scan of a person's face using ReconstructMe software. I then collected self-reported 
information through a form about people's daily waste habits. As I only studied students at Olin, a lot of the household waste of cooking
and cleaning was absent from their personally generated trash. I then 3d modelled the articles of trash, and then positioned them within
the person's portrait sculpture.
