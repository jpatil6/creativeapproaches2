Response to Homework 10 and a hunch for Project 3

In reading about China's dystopian Orwellian credit system, I was agitated by the societal structure this system was inesacapably building towards and what it meant for individual human rights. It was easy to identify the risk of automation in society, and yet somehow I was unable to see a meaningful debugging method for mitigating these risks. Automation is a critical feature of engineering, and in such technological systems there is a universal model, common metrics, and hence some idea of 'optimizing'. In social ecosystems, the subjectivity of model, reference, and scale seems to require a fundamentally different approach.

The promise and mystery of artifical intelligence has captivated me from a young age. Its possibilties has inspired me to imagine a futuristic technological age that would usher the next revolution in human history. The agitation in reading about China's credit system seemed to resonate with something missing from this idea of artificial intelligence; it highlighted that there is also an associated, but distinct co-evolution of societal systems which may be more difficult to match to any measure of 'progress'.

This theme led me to many questions about what it means to develop technology that 'betters' society, and if there could be any way to formalize this process and visualize metrics for it. Since I have more questions than ideas at this point, I would just be trying to develop this 'hunch' through some more research, a little brainstorming, and then constraining the concept from other practical dimensions to arrive at my project 3 idea.
