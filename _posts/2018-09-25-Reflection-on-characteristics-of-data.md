In this contemporary computing age, large amounts of data have a strong overarching presence in personal life. The complexity, magnitude and even the very nature of this data is difficult to fathom. Yet, this intangible concept cuts across personal boundaries in connecting as well as controlling our environments. 

Very simply, data is collected information. This minimal definition should suffice, since I am more interested in exploring what data can be than what it must be. There are multiple philosophies that vary on their definition of 'information', 'knowledge', and 'data'. Instead of getting lost in the debate over these philosophies, I want to understand data through its practical historical significance and the bearing its characteristics have in the modern world.

The modern pursuit of science is analogous to the pursuit of 'truth', which is as old as civilization. Science is at best a model of our understanding of the truth, which we update as new theories that better match this observed 'truth' are discovered. Data as an operative unit in the validation of this truth is contextualized by the knowledge of the data collector, and is so essentially subjective, although the process of data collection may strive towards objectivity. 

In the chapter on 'Representation and the Necessity of Interpretation' in Laura Kurgan's 'Close up at a distance', the author argues that to claim the objectivity of data is not only erroneous, but also dangerous. In the instance provided by the author, in which US intelligence interpreted satellite data to fit their hypothesis of Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction, the dangers of the interpretive nature of data are evident. But the subjectivity of data can be far more subtle, and is often implied in the framework even before the actual data is collected. Its important to note that data is relevant only within the bounds of a predetermined intent and context. A collected dataset is thus sensitive to not only how, but also why it was collected. When a pre-exisiting data is reused in a different context or application, the actual nature of the data hidden behind the numbers may compound different interpretations of the  data's 'truth', which may not be relevant or compatible with the new intent. Datasets are more complex than just a collection of measurements, and since the hidden contexts may be unavoidable, the best way to communicate reliable data would be to clarify the context and make the process of interpretation explicit and transparent. Kurgan describes this model of data handling as 'para-empericism': "[a name for] this effort at once to reclaim a sense of reality and not to imagine this requires doing away with representations, narratives, and images."
